###Adding cards
Adding cards is a somewhat involved process... sorry about that

- Extend the Card class, and add in the features that you wish the card to have (Ask a programm/Matt if you are unsure)
- Set the card's Image and description in the inspector
- Add the prefab for the card into the CardManager's All Cards array in the inspector
- If you wish for the player to start with the card in their deck, add it to the Card Manager's Deck array in the inspector

The card should now be implemented into the game
